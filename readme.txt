**DD Contact Form** by **Dave Wooldridge**

* Fully responsive
* Easy to customise
* Optional additional information fields


**Easy to use**

The DD Contact Form works straight out of the box:

* No registration
* No need for for other plugins
* Fully integrated captcha options

Simple to use and highly configurable, DD Contact Form gives your website visitors a clear, easy to fill in contact form designed to make the message sending process as painless as possible. The form is fully responsive, automagically optimising the layout for even the smallest of screens. The forms' look and feel follows the underlying theme as close as possible, but customisations are easy using the built in css editor and appearance settings. The captcha options offer a choice of built in Simple Addition (works with no sign up) or Google reCaptcha (Google reCaptcha id required). Also integrated into the plugin is a basic but functional contacts management system. Other features include: multiple contact form recipient email addresses, additional question options, date fields and more.

**Appearance Settings**
The form is designed to use the available css (i.e. look and feel) of the underlying theme and so work 'straight out of the box'. However, the form's appearance is also highly customisable by means of the appearance settings and the built in css editor.


**Buttons**
The buttons can be set to use either jQuery-UI or to follow the underlying theme for their appearance. The appearance of the datepickers is also controlled by jQuery-UI. The jQuery-UI theme to use is selectable in the settings (User Interface -> Appearance -> jQuery-UI theme). The available jQuery-UI themes are viewable [here](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ "jQuery-UI themes") in the gallery section on the left.


**Custom jQuery-UI themes**
It is also possible to 'roll your own' jQuery-UI theme using the online [theme rollor](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller "jQuery-UI theme roller"). To use a custom made jQuery UI theme, name your rolled theme jquery-ui-custom.min.css and put it in the plugin's css folder (\wp-content\plugins\dd-contact-form\css) and select it in the plugin settings ()
